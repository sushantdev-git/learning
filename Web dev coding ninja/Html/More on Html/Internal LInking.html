        <p><b><i>Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that, together, laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces. More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force does not exist. These three laws have been expressed in several ways, over nearly three centuries,[a] and can be summarised as follows:</i></b>
            <br>
            <h3>First law</h3><br>
            In an inertial frame of reference, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a force.<br>
            <h3>Second law</h3><br>
            In an inertial frame of reference, the vector sum of the forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration a of the object: F = ma. (It is assumed here that the mass m is constant – see below.)<br>
            <h3>Third law</h3><br>
            When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.</p><hr>
