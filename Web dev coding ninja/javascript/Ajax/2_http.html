        HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
            In client server communication:
            
            1>Client opens up connection with server
            2>Client makes a request to server
            3>Server will process request
            4>Server will send respond to client
            5>Client will close the connection

            Main Request in HTTP are : GET/ POST

            Get: get is used to fetch some data it is present in url
            post: to send some data to server it is hidden

            200: sucessful request
            401: client is not autorized to access data

            HTTP is stateless Protocol
                There is no information of client to which server is respond to.
                Every time a new connection is created on each request.
