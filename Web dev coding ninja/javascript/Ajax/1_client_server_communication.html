        In case of an image brochure:-
        When we click to next image the browser will send request to server and server will
        respond with a we page having different image (which is previous way of doing change
        on web page at live time, and this is not efficient bacause browser have to reload same page
        again). So, now we use 'Ajax' if we have to make changes in web page at live time
        without reloading page.

        In Ajax server send only image and browser replace that image

        Ajax -  Asynchronous javascript and XML

        Understaing Ajax:-
            Type of request:
                Synchronous:
                    Example:
                        if there is two request send to server R1 and R2
                            in synchronous when R1 is completed then only
                            we will be able to send R2
                
                Asynchoronous:
                    Example:
                            We will be able to send R1 and R2 simultaneously
                            and fetech result
                In Ajax we use asynchronous request;

            previously when we made request to server vai Ajax
            sever respond with data in form of XML. This is known as XMLHttpRequest
            Now, XML is repalced with Json files.
