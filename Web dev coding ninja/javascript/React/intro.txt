many giants uses React

how many people actullay use react
    it is used by over 2 million user react




Component based architecture of react:

    in react you divide your website in multiple component and 
    put them together to build the website

    IN case of youtube.com
        1.Navbar is one component
        2.Side bars is one component
        3.Each video box/card is one component  (you can use these video card multipel time)
        4.sign in/out button is an component
        

        In side bar:
            in subscription tab youtube use api to fetch your subscribed channels
            channel and show under subscription tab
            and rest of the component remain unalterd 

Why do we use these library:
    There are two ways to make web app:

        Multiple page application:
            in multi page application there are text/ image/ js / css
            different for different part of web page
                Like you are on home page and you click about, then
                browser will request for about page, and load that whole page
                that is not good way, as it causes delay to load all html /css and js file
            
            jeffery's.com is a multi page appliction
            navigation bar is same but content is changed


        Single page application:
            the web page is not get reloaded again and again
            if you request from some data then, where that data is going 
            to be place on website that will be destroyed and updated with
            new data
            it is done through API

            single page application are fast

            bad things/drawbacks about multi page application is;
                seo optimization
                history


            condingninja website
                nava bar, footer remain same , only that part got chaged 
                according to button you clicked on navbar
        

MVC- Modal view architecture
React is V in MVC


React v/s Other:
    what is a framwork:

        Angular is an framwork

        framework provide structure to the application how our application should be structure

        framwork provide lot of functionalities out of the box 
            like: routing, making ajax request, templating etc.

        framework extensively use api, so it is harder to learn sometime 

    what is a library:
        if you want to manipulate the dom
        you don't have to write lot of vanilla js code
        jQuery is one of the best js library
        lodash is also one js library

        React is part of a library
            and it is V in MVC pattern

        There are two types of pattern:

                ↶   MODEL   ↷

            VIEW           CONTROLLER

                ↘           ↙

                    USER


            MVC-Modal view architecture

                Modal is data of application
                    let modal have name "abc"

                view will display name on webpage
                    view display "abc"

                User sees "abc"

                Controller - if user do some action like onclick
                    then that action will be handeld by Controller
                        change name();

                    controller will change the data accordin to user need

                    view will display the name:
                        this time something "efg"
                
There are tools which used behind in react app:
    Babel: Babel is used to compile JSX into javasript
            JSX - is javasript XML file
                it is used to write html in react
    
    Webpack: webpack is a bundler and it bundle all you files in one file
            and return it which can be directly used in you html main file
