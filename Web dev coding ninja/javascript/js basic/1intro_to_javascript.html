    javascript is a loosely typed language
    one variable can have vlaue of multiple type

    There are 6 Primitive  and 1 object
    Prmitive:
        >Number #64 bit
        >String
        >boolean
        >null        # if you don't have value to variable then you can set it as null;
        >undefined   #If you create a variable and not provide any value to it then it is of undefined type;
        >symbol

    In javascript 1/0 = infinity # hence infinity is a type of value in js.
    Math.pow(10,1000)=Infinity because it is greater than max value stored in js
    Number.MAX_VALUE give max number val can be stored in js

    pasreInt('100')=100
    parseInt('aaaa')=NaN #Not a valid no

    typeof 10 = 'number'   #typeof is used to check type of var
    typeof null = 'object'  # this is a bug
    typeof infinity = 'number' 
    typeof NaN = 'number'
