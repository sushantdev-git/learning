    Arithmatic operator
    +, -, *, /, %

    Assingnment operator
    =, +=, -=, *=, /=

    Uniary operator
    ++a, a++, --a, a--

    comparison operator
    >, <, >=, <=, !=, ==, ===, !==

    logical operator
    && , ||,  !
    and, or, not

    you can add string like this:
    "hello "+"world" = "hello world"
    "hello"+2= "hello2"

    '1'-1=0    # the javascript do the type conversion by itself, in case of addition the int will be converted to string or you can say concatenation happen.
    1+'1'='11' # else string will be converted to int
    '1'*5 = 5
    '1'/2= 0.5

    1 =='1' = true

    The above process is known as 'Type Coercion'

    var a;
    console.log(a + "b");
    output = undefinedb
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    == vs ===
    1 != '1' = False   # here first the string 1 is converted to int and then
                       #comparison occured due to which result is false.
    
    1 !== '1' = True    # to avoid above condition the ===, !== is introduced and in this comparision,
                        # the two value is compared directly with their value and type.
                        # here, no type coercion take place
