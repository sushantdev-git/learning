// // var multiply = function(x,y){
// //     return x*y

// // the above function can be written is smaller format as below
// // this type of function is called arrow funtion

// var multiply = (x,y) => x*y;

// var double = x => 2*x; 

// console.log(multiply(5,4))


//BINDING IN ARROW FUNCTION

/*
    In the given example, the function which is getting returned i.e.
    return function(){ console.log(`The full name of the user is ${this.firstname} ${this.lastname} `); } 
    Is a unbounded function (An unbound function is a function that is not bound to an object) 
    So this in the above function refers to the global (window) object. 
    Since unbound functions are implicitly bound to the global scope). 
    And since no firstname and lastname variables were defined in the window environment, 
    ${this.firstname} ${this.lastname} prints undefined undefined.

//ES6 arrow functions canâ€™t be bound to a this keyword, so it will lexically go up a scope,
