	 The idea is:
	 Every thing is based on objects;
	 communication between objects;
	 
	 User take admission in the batch
	 batch - class
	 user - object
	 
	 batch.giveAdmission(user);
	 
	 	giveAdmission is an functionality in batch that an user can access.
	 
	 user.getAllbatches();
	 
	 user.isEligible();
	 
	 
	 Entire Oops move around two things Classes and Objects:
	 
	 batch - class
	 user - object
	 
	 user can have property like:- name, phone no, address, id, email id,
	 getmarks()
	 
	 To assign all these properties to a student we use class
	 
	 
	 Classes are templates, that a object have/follow
	 classes will decide how a student look like(property) and which functionality it can have
	 
	 Oops refers to using objects in programming
	 A class is a user defined blueprint from which objects are created
	 Objects of same class have different property value
	 Object is an instance(copy, chaap hindi) of class
