	/*
	 Inheritance is the backbone of object oriented programming
	 
	 Inheritance be used for:
	 	Method overriding
	 	Reuseability of code..
	 	
	 It is a mechanism by which we can use some class method and properties
	 can be used in some other class.
	 
	 Super class: Parent class is known as super class
	 subclass: is known as child class
	 
	 It allows the reuse of already developed and debuggeed class program without rewriting it
	 
	 Types of Inheritance:
	 	
	 	1> Single Inheritance : superclass> subclass
	 	2> Mulit_level inheritance : super_super_class > super_class > sub_class
	 	3> hierarchical inheritance : 
	 					 
	 					 	 class A
	 					 	
	 			Class B extend A	class C extend A
 					
 						class D extend A
 			
 			all three class is extension of class A
 		
 		4>Multiple inheritance
 			
 			class A				class B
 				
 					class C : A,B
 				
 			Class c inherit both A and B class.
 			In multilevel inheritance interface is used
